IMPORTANT: this folder does not contain actual system documentation, but rather,
files that support our documentation framework and tools. Actual system documentation
can be found at http://developers.project-inglenook.co.uk

This directory largely exists to support the Doxygen tool. The Inglenook project maintains
a current version of this tools output at http://api.project-inglenook.co.uk. This site
is rebuilt daily to reflect the current state of the softwares main line (master) branch 
which can be checked out from git://github.com/Inglenookians/Project-Inglenook.git

The project-inglenook.doxy file is INCOMPLETE. If you wish to generate your own copy of the 
API site above you will need to provide values for the following keys for your system. These 
key are intentionally left unassigned:
    WARN_LOGFILE        (location for the warnings file that is generated by the tool).
    INPUT               (location of the src folder on your system).
    HTML_OUTPUT         (location of the generated HTML output).
    PERL_PATH           (where Doxygen can find the Perl binary)

More information about Doxygen can be found at http://www.doxygen.org. Its a great tool. Check it out.
